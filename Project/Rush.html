      <h3>A Message from our Rush Chair</h3>
      <p>My name is Frank Levine and I am AEPi Alpha Sigma’s rush chair for 2021. The rush process is such an amazing experience where you will find the home that is made for you and I am so excited to meet the future members of Arizona State's fraternal and jewish community. Every chapter has so much to offer and will positively shape you into a confident and inspiring men. We strive each day to seek our national vision to “provide education, resources and training to the future leaders of the world’s Jewish communities.”</p>
      <p>I myself have learned my true character and built a confidence that I truly hope to promote through each one of my brothers. I am so excited to meet the future class and bring in more brothers to such an amazing community and I look forward to seeing each member's next step forward.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br> Frank Levine</p>
